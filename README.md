# Fetch-Decode-Execute-MemoryAccess-Writeback-System-using-VHDL
To create a VHSIC Hardware Description Language, a hardware description language that is used for describing signal systems such as the Fetch-Decode-Execute-Memory Access-Writeback system. The input is a series of instructions. The design supports a register-register model only, contains two to three address instructions namely the LOAD, ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, and MOD. These support 2-bit inputs and performs integer arithmetic operations. The program should display a five-stage design with each instruction moving from one stage to another in 1 ns clock cycle intervals.
